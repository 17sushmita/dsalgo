# Contributing to Repo_Name
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add sample tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints and follow proper styling (`PEP 8`).
6. Issue that pull request!
7. All pull requests must be documented well

## Commit Guidelines

1. Each commit should link short title and a description (can be short)
2. Each commit message will be like [type] commit_message issueno if solved any
3. Each commit must solve one issue.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions's will be understood the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Suggest New Features
Open Source is the place to collaborate and make a product better and better. So If you want any new features or want to change a feature then you can contact the maintainers of the project or you can create the issue suggesting your features.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://linktotheissuespage)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Bug reports are very helpful in tracking and solving a bug.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- If possible include screenshots and comments.

*People `loves` thorough bug reports.*

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
- `PEP 8` is the default coding style for this project.
- Always test or lint the code before making pull requests.

## License
